In regular business, you pay interest on this borrowing and the loans are usually provided by the banks. In stock trading, this leverage is provided by the broker, and in most of the cases you get it for free (without interest) from your broker. Your broker provides it for free since you would be increasing your turnover; so the broker benefits from brokerage. It also provides better liquidity to the market due to more turnover with lesser investment."
